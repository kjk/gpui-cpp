.SYNOPSIS
    Generate compile_commands.json for clangd from the gpui build system.

.DESCRIPTION
    Creates a compile_commands.json that tells clangd to treat all src/** files
    as part of the amalgam (.work/gpui.cpp), not as standalone TUs. This gives
    correct diagnostics and navigation even when a src/** file is open in the editor.

    The amalgam is the only file that actually compiles; src/** are concatenated
    into it with #line directives for mapping diagnostics back.

.EXAMPLE
    .\cmd\gen-compile-commands.ps1
    # Generates .work\compile_commands.json

.NOTES
    Requires: clang-cl on PATH (VS Installer → C++ Clang Compiler for Windows)
