/* A coroutine that suspends on background work, so a sequence of it reads as
   a sequence.

   This is the smallest thing that makes the port closer to GPUI. Rust spawns
   an `async` block and writes `.await` between the steps; without coroutines
   the same sequence is a job struct, a `work` callback, a `done` callback,
   and — the part that actually costs — a preamble at the top of `done` that
   proves the thing which asked for the work is still there before touching
   anything it owns. `src/shell/runtime.cpp` writes that preamble five times.

     let value = cx.background_spawn(work).await;
     co_await BackgroundSpawn(work);

   What this owns is that preamble. A coroutine registered here carries a
   `TaskGuard`, and the one resume path checks it: if the guard says the owner
   is gone, the continuation is dropped and the frame is destroyed with its
   locals, which is what dropping a Rust `Task` with its entity does.

   Three things it deliberately is not:

   - Not a general async runtime. There is one awaitable — background work —
     and no combinators, no `select`, no cancellation token. Anything that
     needs those wants a bigger reason than a tidier call site.
   - Not `Task<T>`. A coroutine here returns nothing; results live in the
     coroutine's own locals, which is where a job struct's fields were going
     anyway, and they stay alive across the suspend for free.
   - Not scope-cancelled. Rust's `Task` cancels when the view drops it, but a
     view here is an entity with a generation, not a C++ scope, so a `Task`
     that cancelled at the end of the spawning function would cancel every
     one of them. `Task` is an id — the same vocabulary `ExecSpawn` and
     `WindowSetInterval` already hand out — and `TaskCancel` is the drop.

   `<coroutine>` is the one standard header outside the usual list, and hard
   rule 1 in AGENTS.md names it for this reason: it is compiler support rather
   than a library, in the same family as `<new>` — no container, no allocator,
   no exceptions — and the compiler will not accept a hand-written substitute.
   Verified building and running under this tree's own flags on MSVC,
   clang-cl, g++, clang++ with libstdc++, Apple clang with libc++, and
   emscripten.

   Layering: this is `src/sys`, so it knows the executor and nothing above it.
   Entities, windows and policies reach it through `TaskGuard`, the way the
   platform reaches the executor through `ExecSetWake`. A timer awaitable
   belongs in `src/gpui` for the same reason — `WindowSetTimeout` is a window's
   and cancels with it.

   Writing one:

     static Task LintDocument(TaskGuard guard, Doc* doc) {
         LintJob job{doc};
         co_await BackgroundSpawn(MkFunc0(LintWork, &job));
         // Back on the main thread, and `guard` said the owner is still here.
         doc->diagnostics = job.result;
     }

   The guard is the coroutine's first parameter because the promise is built
   from the coroutine's own arguments, and the frame runs to its first suspend
   before the caller sees the `Task` — there is no moment afterwards in which
   to set it. A coroutine with no owner to outlive takes `TaskGuard{}`, which
   is always alive. */
