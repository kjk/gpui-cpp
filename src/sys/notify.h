/* The OS notification center — the platform half of gpui's SystemNotification.

   crates/ui/src/notification.rs bridges a notification to the system's own
   center through four calls on gpui's `App`: post one under a tag, retract
   one by that tag, learn the app's identity, and hear that the user clicked
   one. This is those four, and nothing else: no actions on a notification,
   no sound, no scheduling.

   What is behind them differs by more than the usual amount:

   - Windows: the shell's notification area. A hidden window owns one icon,
     and a post is a balloon on it, which Windows 10 and 11 turn into a real
     toast and keep in the Action Center. That is the whole of the WinRT
     toast API's benefit here without an app identity, a Start-menu shortcut
     or a COM activation server — the price is that only one balloon is on
     screen at a time (a second post replaces the first, which is what the
     tag semantics ask for anyway), that retraction takes the balloon off the
     screen but leaves what the Action Center has kept, and that the app has
     an icon in the notification area for as long as the process runs.
   - macOS, Linux, wasm: not implemented. `SysNotifyAvailable` answers false
     and the system half is dropped. `InAppAndSystem` still shows its in-app
     half; `System` intentionally remains system-only and therefore shows
     nothing, matching a Rust post rejected by an unavailable notification
     center.

   Rust's retraction on Linux is unsupported for the same reason it is
   partial here: the platform keeps what it has shown. */
