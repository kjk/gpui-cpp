/* Focus trap — crates/base/src/focus_trap.rs

   A container that keeps Tab inside it: a dialog, a sheet, an alert. Rust
   registers the container's focus handle in a global FocusTrapManager, and
   Root's Tab action asks `active_focus_trap` whether the focused element is
   inside one before it moves focus. The runtime here already carries the
   trap on the element (`El::TrapId`) and FocusNext already refuses to leave
   one, so this is the other half: which trap has focus, and how focus gets
   into a trap that has just opened.

   A trap id is a hash of a name, the way a click id is, so the same container
   comes back with the same trap across frames. */

//
// `hostFocusId` is the container's own focus id, used only when the trap
// holds nothing that takes tab: Rust's container tracks focus itself, so a

// hears escape. 0 leaves focus outside, which is what an ordinary trap of
// non-stops wants.
