/* Plain text that joins the window's selection —
   crates/base/src/selectable_text.rs

   For an application that wants copyable text without a rich-text document.
   `New` gives a run its own selection; `WithHandle` joins the document a
   TextSelectionHandle belongs to, so several runs read as one — which is what
   the showcase's text-selection page does with its four paragraphs.

   Rust implements Element by hand: it lays a StyledText out, inserts a
   hitbox, registers it with the handle and paints the projected ranges under
   the glyphs itself. The runtime here already does all of that for any
   element that says `Selectable()` — the frame collects its text runs, the
   window's gesture projects onto them in document order and the paint pass
   draws the wash — so this is the same contract expressed as a builder over
   one text element. `SelectionQuadBounds` is the one piece of geometry Rust
   writes out, kept because it is the part with a rule in it. */
