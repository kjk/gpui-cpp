/* The strings a component shows, in the language the application asked for —
   `rust_i18n` and the `crates/ui/locales/ui.yml` catalogue behind it.

   Rust writes `t!("Dialog.ok")` and a macro looks the key up in the locale
   `rust_i18n::set_locale` last named, falling back to the one the crate was
   built with. There is no macro here and no YAML at runtime: the catalogue is
   `locale_data.cpp`, generated from upstream's own file by
   `cmd/gen-locale-data.ts`, so the translations come from upstream rather
   than from a hand transcription, and a later checkin's wording lands by
   re-running the generator.

   What a caller gets back is a `Str` over a string literal, so it outlives
   the frame and needs no copy. A key nothing translates answers with the key
   itself, which is what rust_i18n does — a missing translation shows up on
   screen as `Dialog.ok` rather than as an empty box. */
