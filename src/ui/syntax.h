/* Code-block highlighting without a grammar — crates/ui/src/highlighter

   Rust parses the fence's language with tree-sitter, runs the language's
   `highlights.scm` over the tree and looks the capture names up in a
   HighlightTheme (registry.rs HIGHLIGHT_NAMES, the colors in
   theme/default-theme.json). There is no tree-sitter here and no room for
   one, so this is a scanner: comments, strings, numbers, keywords and the
   few things position alone can tell — a name before `(` is a call, a name
   before `:` in JSON is a property, a name after `<` is a tag.

   That answers a strict subset of the capture names, and the ones it does
   answer take their colors from the same two theme tables, so a fenced block
   here comes out the color a fenced block does there. What it cannot do is
   what a parse buys: a type is a type by convention (Rust, Go, TypeScript
   capitalize them) rather than by resolution, and a keyword used as a name
   is still painted as a keyword. */
